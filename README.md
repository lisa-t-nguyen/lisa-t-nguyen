### 💬 About Me
I'm Lisa, a Software Developer. I know JavaScript, React, Node.js, CSS, and more! I'm open to learning anything and everything! I'm looking for a great, enthusiastic engineering team to work for that will provide me with challenging, interesting work that I can learn from and contribute to!

To me, there is no end to education. Having worked in education for over ten years, I believe that throughout life, we are constantly learning. 

One important facet to me is collaborating with colleagues. This allows us to not only learn from them, but also staying open minded to the suggestions of others. Embracing the vulnerability of learning by being open minded allows us to grow, learn, and explore!

🥳 Fun facts:
- I love gaming! 🎮
- I have two cats 🐈
- I love traveling and adventuring 🏃‍♀️
